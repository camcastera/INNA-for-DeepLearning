# INNA-for-DeepLearning

This is the package for the INNA algorithm based on the paper *An Inertial Newton Algorithm for Deep Learning* ([arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12278)) by C. Castera, J. Bolte, C. Fevotte and E. Pauwels.

It is currently avaiable in Pytorch, Keras, and Tensorflow 1. INNA takes the form of an *Optimizer* object that just need to be imported. To simplify its usage we provide toy examples and explanations.

* [Pytorch Version](https://github.com/camcastera/INNA-for-DeepLearning/tree/master/inna_for_pytorch)
* [Keras Version](https://github.com/camcastera/INNA-for-DeepLearning/tree/master/inna_for_keras)
* [Tensorflow Version](https://github.com/camcastera/INNA-for-DeepLearning/tree/master/inna_for_tensorflow)

_NB_: To begin with Deep Learning we recommand to use Pytorch or Keras.
