# INNA-for-DeepLearning

This is the package for the INNA algorithm based on the paper *An Inertial Newton Algorithm for Deep Learning* ([arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12278)) by C. Castera, J. Bolte, C. Fevotte and E. Pauwels.

It is currently available in Pytorch. Keras, and Tensorflow 1 versions are provided but not updated anymore.  

INNA takes the form of an *Optimizer* object that can be imported an used as any other optimizer (SGD, ADAM, etc.).  Toy examples and explanations are provided.
